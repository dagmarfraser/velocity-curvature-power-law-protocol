Abstract

Bodily movements – from bees, to humans, to elephants – follow highly predictable laws of motion. The one-third power law is amongst the most established of these, so called for the empirically estimated exponent of a relationship between tangential velocity and curvature. Despite being heralded as one of the ‘kinematic laws of nature’ (Flash 2021, p. 4), there is no consensus on its origin, nor principled analytical protocol, or common reporting practice. Despite awareness of analytical shortfalls, suboptimal analysis steps persist in the literature; such as noise amplifying differentiation, filters introducing bias, log transformation distortions, and misapplied linear regression. Reporting is hampered by rival law formulations i.e. one-third vs. two-thirds power law, which may not be interchangeable. These and other issues give scope to questions regarding the power law’s validity. To address these concerns, we distil advances from more than forty years of literature to propose a principled analysis protocol. Such a protocol satisfies need for heightened accuracy in newly emerging, subtle divergences from the law. These power law divergences are a new tool to succinctly quantify the motor impacts of neurochemical disturbances and clinical conditions such as Autism or Parkinson’s. Further, increased finesse in the generation of human-like, predictable motion using the law will facilitate collaboration in human-robot dyads. A principled protocol, to complement a purportedly fundamental law is therefore especially timely.

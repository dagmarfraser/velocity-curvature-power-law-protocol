**Abstract**

Bodily movements – from bees, to humans, to elephants – follow highly predictable laws of motion. The one-third power law is amongst the most established of these, so called for the empirical exponent of a relationship between tangential velocity and curvature. Despite being heralded as one of the ‘kinematic laws of nature’ (Flash 2021, p. 4), there is no consensus on its origin, nor principled analytical protocol, or common reporting practice. Despite awareness of analytical shortfalls, noise amplifying differentiation, filters introducing bias, log transformation distortions, and injudicious linear regression persist in the literature. Reporting is further hampered by rival law formulations i.e. one-third vs. two-thirds power law, which may not be interchangeable. These and other issues give scope to questions regarding the power law’s validity. A purported law of nature should have a principled method of calculation. To address this, we distil advances from more than forty years of literature to construct a more principled analysis protocol. Such a protocol is timely, satisfying a need for heightened accuracy in quantifying newly emerging, subtle divergences from the law. Power law divergences may succinctly quantify the motor impacts of clinical conditions such as Autism or Parkinson’s, as well as neurochemical disturbances, or changes in task medium. Ultimately, more precisely quantified lawful motion will be a boon to diagnosticians, and can be additionally parlayed into the generation of human-like, predictable motion, facilitating collaboration in human-robot dyads.


Keywords: two-thirds power law; one-third power law, kinematics, noise, filters, regression.

**Description**

This repository contains protocols to calculate the Velocity Gain Factor and Beta exponent of the velocity-curvature one-third power law.  Legacy calculations are presented side by side with principled choices extracted from the wider literature.
